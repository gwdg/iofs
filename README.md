## Old README

The code also contains a Grafana reporting submodule that can be easily integrated into any FUSE module.
You may use the code in iofs-monitor.h and elasticsearch.c to integrate it into your own FUSE module.

For more information on how it works, how to use it and how to extend it see [the documentation](https://gwdg.github.io/iofs/book/).
